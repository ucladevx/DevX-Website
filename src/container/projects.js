                <p>Have you ever felt that all you were learning at UCLA was theory, with little opportunities to build out practical applications?</p>
                <p>DevX is a brand new program, launched by UCLA ACM, dedicated to solving that very problem! Build out real-world projects to help tackle pressing problems frustrating the UCLA community, grow your technical skills by pairing up with experienced students, and build a network that lasts beyond graduation.</p>
